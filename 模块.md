##  介绍 

Good afternoon my honorable professors. 
My name is HeJiahui，23years old and I come from Guangzhou.
I'm very happy to be shortlisted to attend this interview. 
I studied at the School of Computer Science and Cyber Engineering of Guangzhou University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. 



## 学业

During my college study, I passed cet-6 and won the third-class scholarship. Before cet-6, because I had not practiced English reading for a long time, I reviewed English in the library every day for a week. Finally, through my hard work, I passed cet-6.

## 实习

During the internship arranged by the school, I served as the group leader. The main content of our school's internship is to train students in Java Web project development. Because my team members and I were new to Java Web development, we didn't use frameworks. The development project mainly uses JDBC technology to connect to Mysql database, and Tomcat technology to handle requests and responses.

As it was the first time for me to be the team leader, I encountered many problems in the process of project promotion. The biggest problem is that the two members of the team of three have a negative attitude towards work, which leads to slow progress. This lets me not only be responsible for team communication, but also for the art and programming of the front-end and back-end code, such as the user login page and its back-end database code.



## 城市

I come from Guangzhou, a central city of Guangdong Province. Guangzhou not only has a rich cultural history, such as morning tea cultural history, but also it has a developed Internet industry. For example, the famous NetEase game company is in Guangzhou. In recent years, the development of the Internet in Guangzhou has a great impact on me, which makes me have a strong interest in computers technology.

## 家庭

I live in a nuclear family. I'm the only child. My mother is a hard-working and determined woman. She always tries her best to finish her work. My father is an easy-going man. He often helps others repair some household appliances. My family is very democratic.  My needs and interests will be fully respected by my parents. At the same time, because my parents have no limit on my mobile phone since childhood, I have strong self-control and will not be addicted to phones. For this, I am very grateful to my parents.



## 爱好

I like painting with PHOTOSHOP, which can improve my art ability and help me find the beautiful side of life. I used to draw till midnight. In the process of painting, I feel happy and satisfied. Not only that, in 2D game making and web design, I can draw the patterns I like, which gives me a sense of achievement in the process of project making.

## 优点

My advantage is that I like to share new knowledge. Whenever I learn new knowledge, I will summarize it and teach it to my roommates patiently. For example, when I finish my college homework, I will see if my roommates have finished it, and if not, I will patiently teach them how to do it. In the process of making my graduation project, I helped another roommate to figure out the direction of making a simple 2d game and found some tutorials for him. When he meets problems, I solve them for him.

## 缺点

My weakness is the lack of planning. During my graduation project, I often code without considering the reusability. For example, while coding a view, I need to display text in the textbox, but I just code without considering that I may reuse it in other views. Later, when I need to reuse it, I changed it to the Singleton Pattern, which increases reusability and reduces coupling.

我的缺点是缺乏计划。在我的毕业设计中，我经常在编写代码时不考虑可重用性，这导致了不方便的扩展。例如，在编写一个视图时，我需要在文本框中显示文本，但我只是在编写代码，而没有考虑到需要在其他视图中使用它。后来，当我需要重用它时，我将其更改为Singleton模式，这增加了可重用性并减少了耦合

## 科研经历

I'm sorry. I have no scientific research experience. But I've been watching videos and reading books about computer graphics recently. I'm looking at the fourth edition of fundamentals of computer graphics. By learning about the rendering pipeline in this book, I understand the rendering process deeper. I used Gouraud Shading for the graphics and made a Blinn Phong Reflection Model by adding ambient light, diffuse reflection, and highlights. 



## 为什么选择考研

First of all, having a master's degree is my dream. Secondly, when I was making games, I developed a strong interest in learning computer graphics and realized my lack of computer knowledge. Therefore, I want to learn more about computer technologies and broaden my horizon through postgraduate study.

## 为什么选择深圳大学

I choose Shenzhen University because it has a very good academic environment in computer science. It ranks fourth in Asia and third in China in computer graphics.  I have a strong interest in computer graphics, and I want to learn and master more computer technologies through the three-year postgraduate study.



## 还会继续考研吗

I will find a job and prepare for the postgraduate entrance exam. Because I am 23 years old and this is the second time for me to take the postgraduate entrance exam. So,I will consider looking for a job first, reviewing the exam content during my leisure time. I may take the postgraduate entrance exam next year.



## 最喜欢的科目

My favorite course is data Structure, because Ms. Zhang Yanling, who is in charge of this course, is my favorite teacher. Her explanation of data Structure is vivid and easy to understand. Although she is very strict, I really like the teacher who can explain knowledge thoroughly.



## 你的学校

I studied at Guangzhou University. Guangzhou University is a good school. Its environment is beautiful, and the teachers are very willing to teach students. It has a good academic learning environment. Its large library contains a lot of books and has a convenient book borrowing system. It is a very good place to study.

## 喜欢的书

My favorite book is the Three-body Problem written by Liu Cixin. I like his description of the future world most. His descriptions of some theories of physics are very vivid and easy to understand.

## 喜欢的运动

I like walking. It gives me time to plan my tasks and summarize recent problems. It makes me feel comfortable and relax my body and mind effectively.

## 最崇拜的人

The person I admire the most is Eiji Aonuma, a game designer who designed nintendo's amazing game Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, which is a reference for the Chinese mobile game YuanShen.
