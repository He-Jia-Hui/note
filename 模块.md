##  介绍 

Good afternoon my honorable professors. 
My name is HeJiahui，23years old and I come from Guangzhou.
I'm very happy to be shortlisted to attend this interview. 
I studied at the School of Computer Science and Cyber Engineering of Guangzhou University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. 



## 学业

During my college study, I passed cet-6 and won the third-class scholarship. Before cet-6, because I had not practiced English reading for a long time, I reviewed English in the library from 8 am to 8 PM every day for a week. Finally, through my hard work, I passed cet-6.

## 实习

During the internship arranged by the school, I served as the group leader. The main content of our school's internship is to train students in Java Web project development. Because my team members and I were new to Java Web development, we didn't use frameworks. The development project mainly uses JDBC technology to connect to Mysql database, and Tomcat technology to handle client requests and responses.

As it was the first time for me to be the team leader of a team project, I encountered many problems in the process of project promotion. The biggest problem is that two of us in the team of three have a negative attitude towards work, which leads to slow progress. This left me not only responsible for team communication, but also for the art and programming of the front-end and back-end code, such as the user login page and its back-end database code.



## 城市

I come from Guangzhou, a central city of Guangdong Province. Not only does Guangzhou have rich cultural heritage, such as the famous morning tea culture, but it also has a very developed Internet industry. For example, the famous NetEase game company is based in Guangzhou. In recent years, the development of science and technology in Guangzhou has a great impact on me, which makes me have a strong interest in the Internet industry.

## 家庭

I live in a nuclear family. I'm the only child. My mother is a hard-working and determined person. She always tries her best to finish her work. My father is an easy-going man. He often helps others repair some household appliances. My family is very democratic. My parents will fully respect my needs and interests. At the same time, because my parents have no limit on my mobile phone since childhood, I have strong self-control and will not be addicted to games. For this, I am very grateful to my parents.



## 爱好

I like painting with PHOTOSHOP, which can improve my aesthetic ability and help me find the beautiful side of life. I used to draw till midnight. In the process of painting, I feel happy and satisfied. Not only that, in 2D game making and web design, I can draw the patterns I like, which gives me a sense of achievement in the process of project making.

## 优点

My strengths are my willingness to listen to others and share new knowledge. Whenever I learn new knowledge, I will summarize and teach my classmates patiently. For example, when I finish my college homework, I will see if my roommate has finished it, and if not, I will patiently teach them how to write code. In the process of making my graduation project, I helped another roommate who had not decided on his graduation project direction to figure out the direction of making simple games and found relevant tutorials for him. When he has a problem, I'm happy to solve it for him.

## 缺点

My weakness is the lack of planning in the production process of the project. When I meet functional requirements in my graduation project, I will directly write corresponding codes, which often leads to code redundancy and inconvenient extension. For example, while coding a view, I have a text display box requirement, but I don't think of it as a generic feature, just the functional requirements of the view, which leads to a high degree of code coupling. Later, I changed it to the Singleton Pattern Pattern, which increases versatility and reduces coupling.



## 科研经历

I'm sorry. I have no scientific research experience. But I've been watching videos and reading books about computer graphics recently. I'm looking at the fourth edition of fundamentals of computer graphics.By learning about the rendering pipeline in this book, I used Gouraud Shading for the graphics and implemented a simple Blinn Phong Reflection Model by adding ambient light, diffuse reflection and highlights. Gained a deeper insight into the rendering process.



## 为什么选择考研

First of all, having a master's degree is my dream. Secondly, when I was making games, I developed a strong interest in learning computer graphics and realized my lack of cutting-edge computer knowledge. Therefore, I want to learn more cutting-edge computer technologies through postgraduate study, and at the same time strengthen my academic knowledge and broaden my horizon.

## 为什么选择深圳大学

I choose Shenzhen University because shenzhen University has a very good teaching environment in computer science. It ranks third in Asia and second nationally in computer graphics. I choose Shenzhen University because I have a strong interest in computer graphics, and I want to learn and master more cutting-edge computer technologies through the three-year postgraduate study.



## 还会继续考研吗

Because I am 23 years old and this is the second time for me to take the postgraduate entrance exam.I will consider looking for a job first, review the exam content during my leisure time, and take the postgraduate entrance exam next year.



## 最喜欢的科目

My favorite course is data Structure, because Ms. Zhang Yanling, who is in charge of this course, is my favorite teacher. Her explanation is vivid and easy to understand with pictures and pictures. Although she is very strict, I really like the teacher who can explain knowledge thoroughly.



## 你的学校

Guangzhou University, where I studied as an undergraduate, is a very good school. Its environment is beautiful, and the teachers are very willing to teach students, has a very good atmosphere of learning environment. It has a large library with a lot of books and a convenient loan system. It is a very good place to study.

## 喜欢的书

My favorite book is the Three-body Problem written by Liu Cixin. I like his description of the science fiction world most, his vivid description of some theories of physics and his conjecture of alien civilization.

## 喜欢的运动

I like walking. It gives me time to plan my tasks and summarize recent problems, and it effectively relaxes my body and mind.

## 最崇拜的人

The person I admire the most is Eiji Aonuma, a game designer who designed nintendo's amazing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, which is a reference for the Domestic mobile game YuanShen.
